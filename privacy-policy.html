        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Simple Version:</strong> HyperJournal keeps everything private and local to your device. We don't collect, transmit, or share any of your data. Period.
        </div>

        <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>HyperJournal is designed with privacy at its core. <strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal information or journal entries.</strong></p>
        
        <p>All data generated by the app is stored exclusively on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Journal entries:</strong> Stored locally in your device's secure storage</li>
            <li><strong>Audio recordings:</strong> Stored locally on your device</li>
            <li><strong>Voice transcriptions:</strong> Processed using Flutter's speech recognition on your device</li>
            <li><strong>App settings:</strong> Stored locally on your device</li>

        <p><strong>We do not share any data with third parties.</strong> There are no analytics, advertising networks, or data brokers involved with HyperJournal.</p>

        <h2>3. Speech Recognition</h2>
        <p>HyperJournal uses Flutter's built-in speech recognition capabilities, which may utilize your device's native speech recognition services (such as Apple's speech recognition on iOS). These services are governed by your device manufacturer's privacy policies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>iOS:</strong> <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple Privacy Policy</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Speech recognition is processed on-device or through your operating system's services. HyperJournal does not send your audio or transcriptions to any third-party servers.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>Your journal entries and audio recordings are stored in your device's secure local storage. We recommend:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using your device's built-in security features (passcode, Face ID, Touch ID)</li>
            <li>Regularly backing up your device to prevent data loss</li>
            <li>Keeping your device's operating system up to date</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Backup and Recovery</h2>
        <p>HyperJournal data may be included in your device's system backups (such as iCloud Backup or iTunes Backup). These backups are controlled by your device's operating system and are governed by your device manufacturer's privacy policy.</p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>HyperJournal does not knowingly collect any information from children. The app is designed for general use and does not target children specifically.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

        <h2>8. Your Data Rights</h2>
        <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> You have full access to all your data through the app</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete entries individually or delete the app to remove all data</li>
            <li><strong>Export:</strong> Your data can be backed up through your device's backup system</li>
