This checklist is a living document. As you learn what works and what doesn't:

- **Update the checklist** with new insights
- **Add new categories** as you discover them
- **Remove items** that don't apply to your situation
- **Share learnings** across all your apps

---

## 💡 **PRO TIPS**

### **Don't Try to Do Everything at Once**
- Pick 2-3 items from Category 1
- Complete them fully before moving on
- Quality over quantity

### **Focus on Impact**
- Category 2 items have the biggest ROI
- Don't get distracted by shiny Category 3 stuff
- Measure what matters

### **Build Systems, Not Just Checklists**
- Create templates for repeatable tasks
- Document your processes
- Make it easier to do the same thing for the next app

## 🚀 **READY TO LAUNCH**

**Your next step:** Pick one app (I recommend HyperJournal since it's already live) and start working through Category 1. Get the basics right, then move to Category 2.

**Remember:** This is a marathon, not a sprint. Build systems that will serve you for years, not just for this one launch.

**You've got this!** 💪
